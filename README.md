# IP Camera and MQTT/Zigbee2MQTT Monitoring System

Advanced monitoring system for IP cameras and MQTT/Zigbee2MQTT sensors with comprehensive session management, real-time visualization, and data exports. Designed for research laboratory environments requiring precise data capture and synchronization.

## System Requirements

- Node.js 20 or higher
- NPM 10 or higher
- MQTT Broker (Mosquitto, HiveMQ, etc.) for sensor connectivity
- Zigbee2MQTT properly configured (for Zigbee device support)
- IP cameras with RTSP or HTTP streaming capabilities
- Environment variables properly configured (see Configuration section)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <directory-name>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file and configure the environment variables:
```env
# Generate a secure random value for SESSION_SECRET
# You can use: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_here

# Server configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000

# MQTT Broker configuration
MQTT_BROKER=mqtt://your-mqtt-broker-ip
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USERNAME=your_username  # Optional
MQTT_PASSWORD=your_password  # Optional
MQTT_USE_TLS=false          # Set to true for secure connections

# Zigbee2MQTT topic configuration
ZIGBEE2MQTT_BASE_TOPIC=zigbee2mqtt
```

3. Configure camera storage directories:
```bash
mkdir -p recordings/sessions
```

4. Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:5000` or the configured PORT environment variable.

To build and start the production server:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

For development purposes, the application automatically connects to configured MQTT brokers and scans for available IP cameras.
